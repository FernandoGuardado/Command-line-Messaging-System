# Command-line-Messaging-System

Multithreaded messaging system built with Python. This application will start a server and let any amount of clients connect to it asynchronously. Each user has a username and password, can check who is online, privately message each other.

This project was meant to show multithreaded app functionality, therefore, no real user authentication; all done inside the text file.
